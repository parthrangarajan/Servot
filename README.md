# Servot
This is my first public bot in Discord.
Discord is an instant messaging and digital distibution platform. Chatting is generally done through a certain user creating a server where he/she can invite all their family, friend
or co-workers.

The main idea behind creating Servot was to tackle the growing depression among people today. With the pandemic not seeming to slow down and with the slow-down in full force, more-and-more people have been plunged into the depths of darkness. Servot is an earnest attempt to lighten the mood and the entire scene in general.

Servot has a few commands like :
1.$hello
2.$introduce
3.$inspire
4.$joke

These commands need to be typed in by the user as they are. Servto also intelligently realises when a person has typed in a sad comment (eg:"I am feeling sad") and then renders a happy, refreshing quote in an attempt to make the person feel better.

Servot uses 3 free apis :\
1.*zenquotes.io* ; To render an inspirational quote\
2.*official-joke-api.appspot.com*;To render a joke\
3.*type.fit*; To render an encouraging quote when a person is feeling a little under the weather

I hope this will make users of the bot feel atleast a little better.\
